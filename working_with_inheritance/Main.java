// Inheritance
// We have observed that when we  have common properties amongst classes
// Say for example manager and programmer  , they are both Employees  
// They share some common  properties
// the class inheriting  or extending the parent class is called subclass
// the class which is inherited by the subcass is called the base class or superclass.


// all classes in java inherit java.lang.object

// Benifits of using Inheritance are as follows
// Smaller derived class definition
// Ease of modification of common properties
// Extensibility
// concentrate on specialized behaviour of you class
// logical structure and grouping

// Subclasses derive all non private variables
